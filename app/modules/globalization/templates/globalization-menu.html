      <h3>When to Use</h3>
<p>There are two scenarios in which to use multiple selectors.</p>
<p><strong>A language varies by country.</strong> Certain languages can have significant differences in vocabulary and grammar according to country. As a result, it’s not enough to offer the user a language alone; we also need to let the user specify the country variant of that language. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>English varies across the United States, Great Britain and Australasian countries</li>
<li>French varies across France, other European countries (such as Belgium and Switzerland), Canada, Africa, Asia and the Caribbean</li>
<li>Portuguese varies across Portugal, Brazil and Africa</li>
<li>Spanish varies across Spain, South America and, Central America </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A country has multiple languages.</strong> Many countries use multiple languages. In this case, we need to offer users a means to specify not only where they’re located but also which language they speak in that location. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>United States residents typically speak American English or Mexican Spanish</li>
<li>Canada residents typically speak English or Canadian French</li>
<li>Switzerland residents typically speak French, Italian, Swiss Standard German or one of a number of Swiss-German dialects</li>
<li>Belgium residents typically speak French, German or Dutch (often referred to as “Flemish”)</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Order</h3>
<p><strong>Country first, language second. </strong>If your product has been tailored to meet local postal requirements, place the country selector before the language selector. This helps clarify to users that the product will include inputs and options specific to their location (such as “states” in the US vs. “provinces” in Canada, inclusion of country-specific carriers, etc).</p>

<p><strong>Language first, country second.</strong> Guidance to come.</p>

<p><strong>Country only. </strong>Show only the country selector when your product appears in a country in which only one language option is offered. For example, a product aimed at residents of Germany is likely to only appear in German.</p>

<p><strong>Language only. </strong>Show only the language selector when your product has been translated into multiple languages but has not been tailored to a particular country.</p>
