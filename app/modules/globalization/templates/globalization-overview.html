    <h2>What is Globalization?</h2>

    <p>When developing world-ready applications, you must pay attention to a variety of issues throughout the application design and development process. The entire process is called Globalization (g11n) and it encompasses three key areas; Internationalization (i18n), Regionalization (r13n) and Localization (l10n).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Globalization (g11n) is an approach to business that embraces a worldwide market perspective rather than merely domestic needs. Successful businesses plan and organize their engineering, sales and marketing, and support activities with all target regions in mind. Even if a new solution is intended for a specific market initially, do not assume that it will never sell globally.</li>
      <li>Internationalization (i18n) is the process of designing, building and testing for international environments so that your software can be adapted to various languages easily, cost-effectively, and in particular without engineering changes. This generally involves isolating the parts that depend on language and culture. The ownership of i18n resides with the product/solution development teams since Internationalization involves designing, coding and authoring.
      </li>
      <li>Regionalization (r13n) is the identification of region or country-specific needs. It becomes necessary when specific regional needs are identified in order for the software to satisfy market requirements. R13n requires domain knowledge and help from local subject matter experts. R13n requirement should be identified at the product definition and requirement stage. Even if the product is properly internationalized, it might not address regionalization needs. These requirements should be also addressed during product development. For instance, be aware of local privacy laws and what we are allowed to do with the data. Do we need to mask certain data for display (e.g., social security number)?</li>
      <li>Localization (l10n) is the process of adapting a product or solution for use in a particular language and country. It involves translation of user interfaces, error messages, images, help, installer, and documentation from the source language (English) to the target languages.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While developing a world-ready application, i18n is the first step in the process: an internationalized application supports localized user interfaces and multi-language data for all users. Truly global applications should be culture-neutral and language-neutral.</p>
    <p>Once the application has been properly internationalized and regionalized, it is important to test for ease of localization (localizability) before performing localization. In this step (pseudo-localization), you ensure that you have separated the application's resources that require translation from the rest of the application's code. Pseudo-localization is discussed later in this document.</p>
    <p>L10n is the last step in the process of developing a world-ready application. In this step, you customize your application for the specific cultures or regions to be supported. If the application has gone through proper i18n and r13n processes, this step should consist primarily of translating the user interface into the target languages.</p>
    <p>If you follow the Globalization framework from early on in the design phase, the amount of time and money required to produce quality localized applications for the target international markets is greatly reduced.</p>
    <p>The Design System supports multiple languages, however bear in mind that not everything comes out of the box, and that certain portions of the code need to be carefully handled to actually make your product 100% localization-friendly.</p>
    <h5>Note</h5>
    <p>You may see globalization and internationalization used interchangeably in some web resources. Similarly for internationalization and localization used interchangeably. At Pitney Bowes we want to be clear with the definitions. Globalization is an overarching umbrella that includes Internationalization, Regionalization and Localization.</p>
    <p>Internationalization is usually a one-time investment. However, Localization must be performed N times (N = number of languages) for every release of the software. Similarly, Regionalization must be done X times (X = number of countries or regions).</p>
