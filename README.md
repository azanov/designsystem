Production-ready compacted CSS file is in `/dist`.

Compiled and processed site files are in `/live_preview`.

Source files are in `/app`.

###Details

The Design System CSS processed and compacted CSS file is in `/dist/styles`. To use the design system in your project, copy `design_system.css` to your project's CSS directory.  You can then create your own CSS file to hold your project's CSS and any overrides needed.

If you'd like to view the "Live Preview" locally, or run the source files to make edits to source:

In your Terminal, navigate (`cd`) into project folder and run `npm install`, then `bower install`.

- To simply view the Live Preview at this point, run `grunt serve:livepreview`. The home page of live preview should open in default browser.
- To run and view the source files, if you want to edit them further, run `grunt serve`.  The project will then run out of the `/app` directory.
