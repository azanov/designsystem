###TL;DR:

Production-ready CSS file is `/build/styles/design_system.css`.

Source files are in `/app`.

**IMPORTANT** instructions to upgrade to version 1.0 or higher from beta versions in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/PBGUX/designsystem/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

###Details

The Design System CSS processed and compacted CSS file is in `/build/styles`. To use the design system in your project, copy this `design_system.css` to your project's CSS directory.  You can then create your own CSS file to hold your project's CSS and apply any overrides as needed.

####If you'd like to view the "Live Preview" locally, or run the source files to make edits to source:

In your Terminal, navigate (`cd`) into project directory and run `npm install`, then `bower install`.

Now run `gulp`.  The project will then run out of the `/app` directory. However, it's best just to add `/build/styles/design_system.css` to your own project.

New versions are posted regularly.  To "update", just replace your copy of `design_system.css` with the one in this `/build/styles` directory.
