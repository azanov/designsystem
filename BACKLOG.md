__ check h4,h5,h6 formatting since these could be used in a product

__ paging, fix "..." button

_X_ enhanced radio and checkboxes need to work with radio-inline




=================================
DONE
_X_ Helpers: spacer classes need media queries (I think we said 75% smaller on phone)

_X_ paging, fix "..." button

_X_ should footer use container, not container-fluid?

__ DAN: fix page scroll issue

__ Using multiple duplicate IDs on headers/footers, since if use "header", the header directive kicks in and replaces mine with the real one.
__ enhanced radio and checkboxes need to work with radio-inline
